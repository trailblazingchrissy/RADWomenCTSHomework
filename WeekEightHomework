    //Assignment:  The following method is supposed to create the number of accounts specified in the argument that it takes.
    //Each Account should be named 'Sample Account #sampleNumber'  where sample number is the count.  So if you created 2 Accounts
    //one would be called 'Sample Account 1' and the other 'Sample Account 2'

    //Also, when we're done inserting them, we will create a case for each one with a Status of 'New', Origin of 'New Account' and the
    //desription and subject of your choice.

    //This isn't working quite right.  Can you use your debugging skills to fix it?  I had to comment it out since it won't compile
    //Look out for consistency and formatting too!  (even if they don't break the code)
    //Add comments to describe what the code is doing.
    //After you get it to compile, run it in execute anonymous and check that it's really working!  Look up your new accounts in your org!
